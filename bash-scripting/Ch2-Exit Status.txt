First parameter stored in $1.

By defaults, variables are global
Variables have to be defined before used

fun k bad global var define hoga to vo call nahi hoga

Local Variables:
Can only be accessed within the function
Create using the local keyword: localLOCAL_VAR=1
Only functions can have local variables

functions have an exit status
0=success
$?=the exit status
Functions can be defined anywhere in a script and be used at any time during a shell script.--false

return1 -- will cause a function to return with an exit status of "1".

ls ?	--	file name with single char starts that will display

		#commands go here.
		;;
